# Gemini SRT Translator Go - Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines identified improvement opportunities for the Gemini SRT Translator Go project. The analysis covers code quality, architecture, security, performance, user experience, and maintainability aspects.

## Project Overview

The Gemini SRT Translator is a well-structured Go CLI application that translates SRT subtitle files using Google's Gemini AI. The codebase demonstrates good Go practices with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive functionality.

## Critical Issues (High Priority)

### 1. Go Module Structure Issues ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Problem**: Go vet reveals issues with internal package usage
- The `go vet` command shows that `internal` packages are being accessed improperly
- This violates Go's internal package visibility rules

**Solution**:
- ✅ Moved shared types and interfaces to public packages under `pkg/`
- ✅ Restructured internal dependencies to follow Go visibility conventions
- ✅ Created proper abstraction layers between internal and external components
- ✅ Fixed all build issues and Go vet warnings

**Changes Made**:
- Created `pkg/config/config.go` with public Config type
- Created `pkg/errors/errors.go` with structured error handling
- Updated all imports to use public packages
- Removed old `internal/config` directory
- All modules now compile successfully

### 2. Test Coverage and Build Issues ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Problem**: Unit tests have compilation issues
- `srt_test.go` has undefined function references
- Example files reference internal packages incorrectly

**Solution**:
- ✅ Fixed test compilation errors by ensuring proper package structure
- ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage for all major components
- ✅ Implemented integration tests for end-to-end functionality

**Changes Made**:
- Fixed SRT test expectations and formatting issues
- Added comprehensive tests for `pkg/errors` package with 100% coverage
- Added comprehensive tests for `pkg/config` package with 100% coverage
- All tests now pass successfully (`go test ./...` shows PASS for all packages)
- Updated example files to use correct public package imports

## Code Quality Improvements (Medium Priority)

### 3. Error Handling Enhancement ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Current State**: Basic error handling with some inconsistencies
**Improvements**:
- ✅ Implemented structured error types with proper error wrapping
- ✅ Added error context with more descriptive messages
- ✅ Created custom error types for different failure scenarios
- ✅ Implemented proper error logging and recovery mechanisms

**Changes Made**:
- Created comprehensive `pkg/errors` package with structured error types:
  - `TranslatorError` with type categorization (validation, api, file, translation, configuration, network)
  - Context support for additional error information
  - Proper error wrapping and unwrapping
- Updated translator package to use structured errors throughout:
  - File operations use `FileError` with file path context
  - API operations use `APIError` with proper error wrapping
  - Validation operations use `ValidationError` with parameter context
  - Translation operations use `TranslationError` with batch context
- Enhanced main.go error handling:
  - Detects structured errors and displays categorized information
  - Shows error context and underlying causes
  - Improved user experience with clear error messages

### 4. Configuration Management
**Current State**: Configuration is handled via struct with environment variable parsing

### 8. Caching System
**Current State**: No caching implemented
**Improvements**:
- Add translation cache to avoid re-translating identical content
- Implement model metadata caching
- Add configurable cache TTL and size limits
- Support cache persistence between runs

## Security Enhancements (High Priority)

### 9. API Key Security
**Current State**: API keys handled as plain strings
**Improvements**:
